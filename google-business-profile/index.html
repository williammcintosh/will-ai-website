              If your business is not showing on Google, it is usually something
              small but important. Wrong category, missing services, messy
              details, or a half finished profile. We fix your Google business
              listing and improve your Google Business Profile so you show up
              for real local searches.

                  Review Fuel works with small to medium New Zealand businesses
                  with physical locations or local service areas. We keep the
                  profile accurate, active, and human so Google and customers
                  can trust it.

            Quick process, no drama. We look at what Google sees, fix the
            basics, then tighten it so it matches how you actually run your
            business.

            <h2>Why is my business not showing on Google?</h2>
            <p>
              Common causes are wrong categories, missing services, bad
              locations, duplicate listings, inconsistent contact details, or a
              profile that looks inactive. Sometimes it is as simple as your
              hours, service area, or name not lining up across your website and
              listing.

            <h2>How do you fix a Google business listing?</h2>
            <p>
              We clean up your core details and structure. Categories, services,
              description, photos, links, and anything that confuses Google or
              customers. The goal is a listing that reads clearly and matches
              reality.

            <h2>How do you improve a Google Business Profile?</h2>
            <p>
              We make it look alive and legit. Better service descriptions, real
              photos, sensible Q&amp;A, and a plan for steady review activity.
              This helps you show up more often and look like the obvious choice
              when people compare options.

            <h2>Google Q&amp;A that actually helps</h2>
            <p>
              We add and answer common questions directly on your Google
              Business Profile. This stops confusion, prevents random answers
              from the public, and helps customers decide faster.

            <h2>Photos that show real operations</h2>
            <p>
              We guide what photos to add so your listing reflects real work,
              real locations, and real people. This builds trust and helps when
              a business is not showing on Google consistently.

            <h2>Light activity that keeps the profile alive</h2>
            <p>
              You do not need constant posting. We add sensible updates only
              when they make sense, so the profile stays active without turning
              into busy work.

            <h2>Do you need admin access?</h2>
            <p>
              Yes. To fix your Google business listing properly, we need admin
              access to your Google Business Profile. We only touch what is
              agreed in the plan.

            <h2>Can you do this if I am service area only?</h2>
            <p>
              Yep. Trades and mobile services are common. We set it up so you
              can show up locally without needing customers to walk into a shop.

            <h2>Will this alone get me more customers?</h2>
            <p>
              It helps a lot, but the real win is pairing it with review
              requests and review replies so your profile stays active and keeps
              building trust over time.
